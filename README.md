# Quora Question Pairs / Duplicate question pairs
The Quora Question Pairs dataset is commonly used for identifying duplicate question pairs. The goal is to determine whether two given questions on Quora are semantically equivalent. Here's an overview of the dataset and how it's typically used in duplicate question detection tasks:

# 1. Dataset Description:
The Quora Question Pairs dataset consists of question pairs from the Quora platform. Each row includes:

qid1: ID of the first question.

qid2: ID of the second question.

question1: The text of the first question.

question2: The text of the second question.

is_duplicate: A binary label indicating whether the two questions are duplicates (1) or not (0).

# 2. Objective:
The task is to develop a model that predicts whether two questions are duplicates. This involves building a binary classification model using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to assess the similarity between the question pairs.

# 3. Approach to Solving the Problem:
Here are common steps used in building a solution for the duplicate question pairs problem:

### A. Data Preprocessing:
Text Cleaning: Remove special characters, stopwords, and perform tokenization and stemming/lemmatization.

Feature Engineering: Create features like question lengths, common words, character overlaps, etc.

Word Embeddings: Use pre-trained embeddings such as GloVe, Word2Vec, or BERT to represent questions as vectors.
### B. Modeling:
Traditional Machine Learning: Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, XGBoost, etc., can be used on the extracted features.

Deep Learning: Models like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), or transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa) can be trained to capture the semantic similarity between questions.

Similarity Metrics: Techniques like cosine similarity, Jaccard similarity, or Manhattan distance between vectorized representations can also help in determining question similarity.
### C. Evaluation Metrics:
The models are usually evaluated using:

Accuracy: The percentage of correctly predicted duplicate and non-duplicate pairs.

F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, especially important for imbalanced datasets.

Log Loss: A loss function used to penalize incorrect classifications.
### 4. Challenges:
Semantics over Syntax: Some questions may have different wordings but convey the same meaning, making it challenging for models that rely on syntactic features.

Class Imbalance: The dataset typically has more non-duplicate pairs than duplicate ones, so techniques like class weighting or oversampling might be needed.
